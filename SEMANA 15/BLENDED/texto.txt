I believe in                              everything I see.
I believe   you do                            the best for me.
It's not a lot.
It's all   I've got.
I believe                              that the day will come.
When you see that your the only one.
And               the                          rain will fall from the sky.
This is goodbye.
Is there anyone you can call.
Have you got nobody left at all.
Your                map's                          against the wall.
Is                                  there no                         place else you'd rather be.
Did you give                               it all up just for me.
I'm                        sorry if                           you got me wrong.
I                           forgive you in a song.
I wish                 that i could sore in the sky.
I                          wish that i                          could fly, fly, fly.
I say goodbye to my mother and bye to my dad.
You're all I              have.
Is there                            anyone you can call.
Haveâ€¦
